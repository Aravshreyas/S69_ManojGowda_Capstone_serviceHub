# ServiceHub: A Professional Service 	Connection Platform


## Idea Brief:
ServiceHub is a web-based platform designed to connect clients with professionals across various domains, including lawyers, CAs, freelancers, carpenters, plumbers, and other service providers. The platform allows clients to browse professional profiles, inquire about services, and receive responses from experts.
ServiceHub bridges the gap between professionals and clients by offering profile listings, an inquiry system, and a pay-per-inquiry model for monetization.

## Core Features:
1️. User Authentication – Clients and professionals can register, log in, and manage profiles.
2️. Dashboard – Clients can browse available services, professionals, and businesses.
3️. Professional Profiles – Each professional has a dedicated profile with a photo, experience details, services offered, and contact methods.
4️. Inquiry Form & Email Notifications – Clients can send inquiries via a form, and professionals receive inquiries via email.
5️. Monetization (Pay-Per-Inquiry) – Professionals load credits into their ServiceHub wallet to unlock client inquiries.
6️. Business & Shop Listings – In addition to individual professionals, businesses offering services can be listed.
